                Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Then we'll go with that data file! But existing is basically all I do! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! It's a T. It goes "tuh". Moving alongâ€¦ Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Actually, that's still true. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Oh God, what have I done? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Now what? Ooh, name it after me! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Is the Space Pope reptilian!?
